        Beautiful is better than ugly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Explicit is better than implicit.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Simple is better than complex.
    </p>

    <p>
        Complex is better than complicated.
    </p>

    <p>
        Flat is better than nested.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sparse is better than dense.
    </p>

    <p>
        Readability counts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although practicality beats purity.

    <p>
        Errors should never pass silenced.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unless explicitly silenced.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    </p>

    <p>
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now is better than never.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although never is often better than *right* now.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    </p>

    <p>
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
